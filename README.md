# IGC Climate Actions Manager

A tool to apply multiple climate actions to diagrams in your design in Geodesignhub using the [Geodesignhub API](http://www.geodesignsupport.com/section/api/). This project uses the API to get text descriptions of diagrams, systems, change teams and users and produces a text based version of the diagram data in the project.
